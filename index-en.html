        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shipwreck is the wreckage of a ship that is located either beached on land or sunken to the bottom of a body of water. Shipwrecking may be intentional or unintentional. Angela Croome reported in January 1999 that there were approximately three million shipwrecks worldwide (an estimate rapidly endorsed by UNESCO and other organizations).
        <br><br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many factors determine the state of preservation of a wreck:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
          <li>the ship's construction materials</li>
          <li>the wreck becoming covered in sand or silt</li>
          <li>the salinity of the water the wreck is in</li>
          <li>the level of destruction involved in the ship's loss</li>
          <li>whether the components or cargo of the wreck were salvaged</li>
          <li>whether the wreck was demolished to clear a navigable channel</li>
          <li>the depth of water at the wreck site</li>
          <li>the strength of tidal currents or wave action at the wreck site</li>
          <li>the exposure to surface weather conditions at the wreck site</li>
          <li>the presence of marine life that consume the ship's fabric</li>
          <li>temperature</li>
          <li>the acidity (or pH), and other chemical characteristics of the water at the site</li>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">MV Doña Paz</h2>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippine-registered passenger ferry MV Doña Paz was en route from Leyte Island to Manila when it sank after colliding with the oil tanker MT Vector on 20 December 1987.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history, the collision claimed the lives of at least 4,386 people.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports then revealed that the vessel was overcrowded, the vessel did not have a radio and passengers didn’t have immediate access to life jackets.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship, now known as ‘Asia’s Titanic,’ was mostly destroyed in the collision due to the fire.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Halifax Explosion</h2>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Halifax Explosion was a disaster that occurred in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, on the morning of 6 December 1917. SS Mont-Blanc, a French cargo ship laden with high explosives, collided with the Norwegian vessel SS Imo in the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin. A fire on board the Mont-Blanc led to a massive explosion that devastated the Richmond district of Halifax. Approximately 2,000 people were killed, largely in Halifax and Dartmouth, by the blast, debris, fires, or collapsed buildings, and an estimated 9,000 others were injured. The blast was the largest human-made explosion at the time, releasing the equivalent energy of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT (12 TJ).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mont-Blanc was under orders from the French government to carry her cargo from New York City via Halifax to Bordeaux, France. At roughly 8:45 am, she collided at low speed, approximately one knot (1.2 mph or 1.9 km/h), with the unladen Imo, chartered by the Commission for Relief in Belgium to pick up a cargo of relief supplies in New York. On the Mont-Blanc, the impact damaged benzol barrels stored on deck, leaking vapours which were ignited by sparks from the collision, setting off a fire on board that quickly grew out of control. Approximately 20 minutes later at 9:04:35 am, the Mont-Blanc exploded.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">MV Le Joola</h2>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MV Le Joola was a Senegalese government-owned roll-on/roll-off ferry that capsized off the coast of The Gambia on 26 September 2002, with 1,863 deaths and 64 survivors. It is thought to be the second-worst non-military disaster in maritime history.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship was plying the route from Ziguinchor in the Casamance region to the Senegalese capital, Dakar, when it ran into a violent storm, farther out to sea than it was licensed to sail. The estimated 2,000 passengers aboard (about half of whom lacked tickets) would have amounted to nearly four times the ship's design load. The large numbers sleeping on-deck (and thus above its center of buoyancy) added further instability. Rescue operations did not start for several hours.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A government inquiry principally blamed negligence, and accusations were levelled at both the Senegalese president and prime minister.<br>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Sultana</h2>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the worst and least recognised maritime disasters in the history of the US, the explosion and sinking of steamboat Sultana on 27 April 1865 took 1,800 lives in the Mississippi River, near Memphis.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship was used at the end of the American Civil War to transport the POWs from the Union army back home and the vessel met with an accident after the explosion of its boilers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wreck of the ship was found in the year 1982 in a soybean field on the Arkansas side, around 6 km from Memphis.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Featuring few relics from the ship, a temporary Sultana Disaster Museum was opened in 2015, on the 150th anniversary of the tragedy.

      <div class="more-fifth">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">RMS Titanic</h2>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RMS Titanic, the most famous ship for never making her destination, was the largest cruise ship of its time. The Titanic was built in Ireland at the Harland and Wolff shipyard. It was considered to be the most developed ship of that era.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Titanic, which was famously described as ‘unsinkable,’ unfortunately sank after colliding against an iceberg in its maiden voyage- from Southampton to New York City- on 14 April 1912, in the North Atlantic Ocean.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 1, 517 people lost their lives in one of the biggest marine tragedies in history.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many unsuccessful expeditions, the wreck was finally located by a joint French–American expedition in 1985. Quite a number of artefacts have been removed from the shipwreck and they are displayed in the National Maritime Museum, in England.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many schemes were proposed to raise the ship, but the fragile condition of the vessel prevented such plans.  The wreck of the RMS Titanic is now protected by the 2001UNESCO Convention.<br>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">RMS Empress of Ireland</h2>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian ocean liner RMS Empress of Ireland sank near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River on 29 May 1914 after colliding with the Norwegian collier SS Storstad due to thick fog, killing 1012 people.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vessel was en route from Quebec City to Liverpool, with 1057 passengers and a crew of 420 abroad when the vessel went down in one of the worst disasters in Canadian maritime history.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the wreck of Empress of Ireland lies in a shallow 130 ft of water.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On several occasions after the incident, several divers have successfully recovered many valuables including silver bars, a brass bell and a stern telemeter etc from the ship.<br>
